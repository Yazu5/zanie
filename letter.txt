hi, Yxzanie

i wanted to write you this christmas letter because this season always reminds me to appreciate the people who made my year meaningful. meeting you is one of those things i’m genuinely grateful for. life has a funny way of bringing people together, and i’m glad ours crossed. even as friends, you’ve had a positive impact on me.

this christmas, i wish you genuine happiness. not the loud or forced kind, but the quiet happiness that makes you feel content and at peace. i hope you find joy in small moments, in rest, and in the people who truly care about you. you deserve a life that feels light and fulfilling.

i also wish you good health, both physically and mentally. i know how exhausting life can get, especially when you’re carrying things silently. i hope your body feels strong and your mind feels calm. sana palagi mong alagaan ang sarili mo, because you matter more than you think.

mental health is something people don’t talk about enough, but it’s so important. i hope your thoughts are kind to you, especially on days when you feel overwhelmed. if there are moments when everything feels heavy, i hope you remember that it’s okay to pause and breathe. you don’t always have to be strong.

i’m really thankful that we got to know each other. i appreciate our conversations, the random moments, and the simple honesty we share. even the small interactions meant something to me. i value the connection we built as friends.

christmas is also a time to say thank you, and i want to thank you for being yourself. for being real, for being open in your own way, and for existing as you are. not everyone leaves a good impression in someone’s life, but you did in mine.

there were days this year that felt tiring and confusing, but having people like you around made things feel a little easier. sometimes just knowing someone is there makes a difference. i hope i was able to give you that same sense of comfort, even in small ways.

i wish for you to enter the new year feeling hopeful. i hope your worries slowly lessen and your confidence grows stronger. may you find clarity in moments of doubt and peace in moments of chaos. you deserve good things ahead.

if you ever feel like life is getting too heavy, i want you to know that you can talk to me. no pressure, no expectations. kahit rant lang or silence, that’s okay. i’m here to listen whenever you need someone.

i won’t pretend to have all the answers, but i can offer presence and understanding. sometimes, being heard is enough. you don’t have to filter yourself around me. your thoughts and feelings are valid.

i hope this christmas gives you time to rest, to reflect, and to feel appreciated. take a break from stress, even if it’s just for a while. you’ve done your best this year, and that’s already something to be proud of.

thank you for being part of my life this year. i’m grateful that we met, grateful that we talked, and grateful that we became friends. those things may seem simple, but they matter to me.

i hope the coming days bring you warmth, comfort, and a sense of belonging. may your heart feel lighter and your mind clearer. i truly wish you happiness in every form

take care always, and remember you’re not alone.
i’m here if you ever need someone to talk to.

Merry Christmas.
